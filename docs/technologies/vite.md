# ViteJS

[ViteJS](https://vitejs.dev)

## Motivation

ViteJS serves two purposes:

- A hot-reloading development server
- A build tool to convert JavaScript and Vue files into a static website

## Usage

### Development

To run the development server, run `npm run dev` in the root directory. This will start a server and print out the relevant
port in the terminal window.

### Production

Run `npm run build` to build the static website. The output will be in the `dist` directory.
